# Introduction

_Write awesome documentation for UI components with Docz and Ztopia theme!_

## Why Docz?

_It's never been easier to document your things!_

Let's all admit the fact that most engineers do not like writing documentation,
needless to say writing awesome documentation. We cannot really blame on them
for being lazy nor too smart to write some dummy text instead of code.
Given the fact that engineers are always too busy with rushing projects to production,
fixing regression bugs, arguing with coworkers, it is vital to have a documentation
tool that requires no additional effort and time to write awesome documentation.
[Docz](https://www.docz.site/) is by far my favorite UI documentation tool that
makes me as a writer efficient and you as a reader happy

You might be wondering: how is Docz better than [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)?
Don't get me wrong. Storybook can surely be a powerful UI documentation tool as well,
only if your team members and you know how to configure and use it properly.
See, this is the biggest difference between Docz and Storybook:
engineers firstly need to learn how to configure and use Storybook properly
before they can write awesome documentation, whereas Docz fully leverages [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
allowing us to directly import UI components in markdown, making the documenting experience truly great.
Personally, I feel like writing documentation with Storybook is more like writing JavaScript tests,
whereas writing documentation with Docz is more like writing kindergarten journals

Secret, don't tell anyone else: the company I am working for moved away from
Storybook to Docz!

## Why Ztopia Theme?

For a long time, Docz has been lonely with just one look,
[the default theme](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/tree/master/core/docz-theme-default).
Now, let's embrace its new look with the Ztopia theme! Well, creating a new look
is just one of many reasons I want to start this project. Below are more reasons
why you should switch to the Ztopia theme:

- **Aesthetically pleasing design**: inspired by
  [Ant Design React](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) and
  [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), 40% of my time was devoted to the Ztopia UI&UX
  when I built this theme. Why? because I believe great UI&UX
  can attract people reading documentation :)

- **One theme, two looks**: Ztopia theme comes with light and dark mode. You can click
  the light bulb in top right corner to see the difference. If your component also
  supports light and dark theme, you can import `ThemeConsumer` from this library,
  and use it to theme your components.
  See [Button.mdx](https://github.com/zicodeng/docz-theme-ztopia/blob/master/example/Button.mdx) for an example

- **Gracefully handle complex prop shape**: it is common to have component props
  that accept complex shapes. Inlining them as plain text like this
  `PropTypes.shape({ firstName: PropTypes.string.isRequired, lastName: PropTypes.string.isRequired, ...})`
  is probably not a best way to show. Fortunately, Ztopia handles complex shapes automatically for you.
  Whenever you see `Shape` type in props table, it means you can hover it
  and see your complex shape. Check out examples
  in [Design](http://docz-theme-ztopia.surge.sh/docs/design) page

- **Description with inline code**: when you write descriptions for props,
  you can embed inline code like this /\*\* This is `code` \*/

- **Playground with built-in iframe support**: the default Docz `<Playground>` is really cool,
  but it does not serve your components in an isolated browsing context.
  This makes developers hard to test component responsiveness and lead to
  possible CSS collisions between Docz default theme style and component style.
  There is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/789) discussing about it.
  With the above reasons in mind, Ztopia theme `<Playground>` is built with `<iframe>` support in mind,
  so that you can build your components in isolation.
  See [Button](http://docz-theme-ztopia.surge.sh/components/button) page for an example.
  (If you are not thinking about switching to Ztopia theme, but still need `<iframe>` Playground support,
  check out this [plugin](https://github.com/zicodeng/docz-iframe-playground) I wrote)

## Star Ztopia on GitHub

This project is completely open source and free of charge. If you like it,
[star Ztopia theme](https://github.com/zicodeng/docz-theme-ztopia) on GitHub. Your support is my biggest motivation :)
