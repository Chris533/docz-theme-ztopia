_It's not just another UI library. It's an entire world!_

Getting tired of viewing your website with just one basic theme across pages? Well, you are not alone. Most UI libraries on the market do not support multiple themes. It has always been time-consuming and challenging for companies to build multi-themed websites. This is why we are creating Ztopia UI, **a React UI library built with multi-theming in mind**. We aim to deliver UI components with easy-to-use API so that you can enjoy different lookings of your awesome websites without any overhead.
